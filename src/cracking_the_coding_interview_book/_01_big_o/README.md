## Big O

We often hear the performance of an algorithm described using Big O Notation.

The study of the performance of algorithms – or algorithmic complexity – falls into the field of algorithm analysis.
Algorithm analysis answers the question of how many resources, such as disk space or time, an algorithm consumes.

We'll be looking at time as a resource. Typically, the less time an algorithm takes to complete, the better.
