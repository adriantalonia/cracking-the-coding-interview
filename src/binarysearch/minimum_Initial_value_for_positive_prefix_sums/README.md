## Minimum Initial Value for Positive Prefix Sums

You are given a list of integers nums. Return the minimum positive value we can append to the beginning of nums such
that prefix sums of the resulting list contains numbers that are all greater than 0.

### Constraints

> n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums

### Example 1

Input

```
nums = [2, -5, 3, 2]
```

Output

```
4
```

Explanation

```
If we have append 4 to the list then we have [4, 2, -5, 3, 2].

The prefix sums are then [4, 6, 1, 4, 6], all of which are > 0.
